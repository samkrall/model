This is a project I created to deploy a simple ML model to a webapp using flask. CSV data is contained in data folder. 
My HTML template is contained in the template_folder. There is a jupyter notebook titled "Heart Disease Exploration and Model Building" which contains
exploration of the dataset (which was previously adjusted/munged before I got ahold of it). Train.py contains the creation of the ML model. App.py contains my code
for the webapp creation.
